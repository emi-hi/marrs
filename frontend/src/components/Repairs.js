        Please note that accurate estimates are not possible without a bench evaluation of the condition of your gear.

          There is a diagnostic fee for all repairs. After the diagnostic I will contact you with an estimate, at which point you can make a decision if you want to proceed with the repair. The diagnostic fee is taken out of the final repair charge.
